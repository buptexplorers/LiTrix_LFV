# LiTrix_LFV
LiTrix is a lightweight scheme for light field video (LFV) capturing and processing. We present a prototype of LiTrix with a portable 100-camera array. Through the array we record a novel LFV dataset, providing a good level of diversity with the texture of the scene changes varies from paper to ceramic to cotton.

The dataset is available for free as long as it is used for non-commercial and research purposes. It can be downloaded from the file XXX. The camera parameters of each industrial camera within the array is under file XXX.

Currently only key frames of the LFV are provided here. This might change in the future if our work be accepted or published. Part of our work has already submitted to IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, and some extended work is being prepared. We will also contribute more videos to the dataset.
